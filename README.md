# minecraft-bot
Hello! This is my first project, so I'm pretty nervous. This is also my first open source project.

## Rationale
I built this bot for Minecraft, because I always had trouble being kicked out due to AFK. This bot will help me produce some movements which can help me from not being kicked out.

## Implementation
This bot is built using JavaScript (a programming language I learnt specifically to build this bot) and mineflayer.
The bot only works upto 1.16.4, I'll work on it in my free time to port it over for latest version.

## Prerequisites 
1. NodeJS
2. Minecraft

## Commands
Step 1: Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
Step 2: Change the port number and IP address to the SERVER ADDRESS, otherwise it will not work.
Step 3: Run `npm dev` to run the js file.
